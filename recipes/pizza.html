    <p>This is my pizza recipe, FAR from perfect, but loved by everyone in the fam. It is not so hard to make, and I usually make 4 pizzas at a time. The dough is the same as the bread dough but remove the eggs, so... there's that.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>For the dough: </b></li>
        <li class="pizza item">Butter</li>
        <li class="pizza item">Sugar</li>
        <li class="pizza item">Baking powder</li>
        <li class="pizza item">Baking Soda</li>
        <li class="pizza item">Yeast</li>
        <li class="pizza item">Milk</li>
        <li class="pizza item">Flour</li>
        <li class="pizza item">Oil (for the rising ting, just a lil)</li>
        <li class="pizza item">Spices (optional)</li>
        <li><b>For the toppings: </b></li>
        <li>Peppers (Green, red, yellow)</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Minced meat</li>
        <li><a href='tomato-stew.html'>Tomato stew</a></li>
        <li>Peperoni (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough. The steps are the same as the steps for <a href="bread.html">bread</a>, except the eggs, but that is for 4 pans. Vary the liquid ingredients to control the number of pans.</li>
        <li>Once the dough is in for rising, cut all the ingredients for the toppings. Make some onion rings as well.</li>
        <li><b>MINCED MEAT</b></li>
        <li>Wash the minced meat and leave it to drain in a sieve.</li>
        <li>Put a little bit of oil into a pot</li>
        <li>Put about 2tbsp of diced onions into the slightly hot oil.</li>
        <li>While the onions are burning (lol), get the minced meat ready. It needs as little water in it as possible or else you die.</li>
        <li>After about 2-3mins, put the minced meat into the onions. Stir it for about 5 mins.</li>
        <li>When you are done stirring it, you need to add spices to it. And salt.</li>
        <li>Once you add the spices, let it cook for 2-3mins and go stir it again.</li>
        <li>Keep repeating the process of stir and rest until the meat is brown.</li>
        <li>Taste the meat and see how bad it is and then cry inside.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is done, remove it from the cooker. It will definitely have some water inside, and if possible, you need to sieve it out.</li>
        <li><b>Salad-ish-thing</b></li>
        <li>Put alittlebitta oil into a pan. Any type of pan.</li>
        <li>Put in the non-ringy onions first. As they fry, add in all the spices.</li>
        <li>Put in the peppers and the onion rings.</li>
        <li>Fry them for about 2 mins and then you are done.</li>
        <li>If they get soggy, you are a bad chef.</li>
        <li><b>COMBINATION</b></li>
        <li>Now that you have your dough, cut it into 4 equal slices.</li>
        <li>Take one of the slices and roll it into the shape of your pan.</li>
        <li>Put some cooking spray into the pan and then put the dough inside.</li>
        <li>Smear some tomato-stew across the pan.</li>
        <li>Put the minced meat into the pan. Then peperoni if you have, then the veggies.</li>
        <li>Put the grated cheese on top. If you have sheet cheese, but it before the veggies.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375 until done. Takes about 20-40.</li>
        <li>Repeat this for all 4 pans.</li>
    </ol>
