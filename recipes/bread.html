    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Oil (maybe)</li>
        <li>Spices (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 1.5 teaspoon of yeast in water (and set aside)</li>
        <li>Melt the butter (and make sure the milk is warm)</li>
        <li>Get a bowl and mix all dry ingredients into the bowl.</li>
        <li><em>Dry ingredients: Cinnamon, tumeric, cumin, coriander, baking soda, baking powder, garlic powder, ginger powder, salt, sugar.</em></li>
        <li>Whisk 2 eggs and add into the bowl of dry stuff. (remain a little for later)</li>
        <li>Add warm milk into the bowl (also save a little for later)</li>
        <li>Add the yeast we made in step one.</li>
        <li>Mix Well! and add flour in small batches, mixing every time.</li>
        <li>Keep mixing well until you get to the right consistency. (yes, i dont know either, just when it feels right i guess)</li>
        <li>When the flour is done roll it into a giant ball and transfer it into another bowl (hopefully a big one) and cover it for rising.</li>
        <li>Keep it somewhere for one hour (COVERED PROPERLY!!!!). After an hour, open it.</li>
        <li>Knesd the dough and cut it into shapes (i prefer them round, its up to you)</li>
        <li>Grease the pan with oil or butter. (Or maybe you have a spray, that's fine too)</li>
        <li>Put your bread shapes into the greased pan.</li>
        <li>Use a mix of the remaining egg and milk and spread on top of the nread. do not let it touch the pan (if possible)</li>
        <li>Set the pan aside for 45 mins to rise again.</li>
        <li>After 35 mins, preheat your oven to 375 degrees Farenheit (190C)</li>
        <li>Bake for around 45 mins. Usually takes me 1 hour, but just be there until it is done.</li>
    </ol>
